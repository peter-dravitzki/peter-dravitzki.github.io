    <h2>
      What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due
      to the core learning?
    </h2>
    <p>
      learning about emotions is important to dealing with others, i cant do
      everything on my own, there is always a way to communicate
    </p>
    <h2>
      What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and
      programming?
    </h2>
    <p>
      they give you opportunities to improve your own learning and the learning
      of others
    </p>
    <h2>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h2>
    <p>
      It seemed like an insurmountable task before i started but it wasnt so
      when i just sat down and answered the first thing that came to my mind
    </p>
    <h2>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h2>
    <p>Getting started</p>
    <h2>
      Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time
      focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
    </h2>
    <p>to help us get a job and stay in it</p>
    <h2>
      Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of
      time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead?
      Justify your answer.
    </h2>
    <p>
      No, there is always practise more coding on your own but in order to
      practise the core learning it needs others so at a bootcamp where everyone
      is doing the same makes perfect sense.
