      <p>
        When designing the layout of a website there are many decisions to make.
        One of them is how you want the different part of each page to display
        to the user. There are 3 ways parts can be displayed: inline,
        inline-block, and block. At this time I shall discuss the differences
        between inline and inline-block.
      </p>
      <p>
        Inline display is when the content is displayed in the same line as the
        previous content and the height and width of the content is unchanged.
        Whereas inline-block allows the width and height of the content to be
        changed.
