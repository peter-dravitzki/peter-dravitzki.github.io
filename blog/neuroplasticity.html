      <p>
        Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits
        people.
      </p>

      <p>
        Similar to muscle memory neuroplasticity allows practicers to becouse so
        accustomed to a task it becomes almost 2nd nature allowing them to
        complete tasks quicker and without much effort.
      </p>

      <p>
        Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for
        your benefit.
      </p>

      <p>
        By repeating difficult tasks over and over again the brain creats more
        efficient neuron pathways to enable quicker processing of the steps in
        that task
      </p>

      <p>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</p>

      <p>
        Practise, put it in context and to remind myself this is how it works

      <p>Discuss what it is and why it is relevant.</p>

      <p>
        A growth mindset is a way of thinking that gets you motivated to
        improve. This can be done by asking yourself open ended questions that
        affirm the possiblity of improvement rather than the fixedness of where
        you are.
      </p>

      <p>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</p>

      <p>Yes it gave me motivation to improve.</p>

      <p>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</p>

      <p>
        Firstly i can Affirm that i will be getting better at programming,
        secondly it gave me a sense of calm when i have been struggling with
        something that it can be resolved.

      <p>
        Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or influence your
        learning plan and strategy.
      </p>

      <p>
        Going forward i will ask myself a few questions when starting to learn.
