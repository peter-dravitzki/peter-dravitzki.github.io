    <h2>Tell your non-tech friend a story about a time you:</h2>

    <h2>1. were blocked on a simple problem:</h2>

    <h3>what was the problem?</h3>
    <p>
      my brand new mower wouldnt start and i tried every thing i could think of
      with my experience to get it started but it would nt start
    </p>
    <h3>what problem-solving techniques did you use?</h3>
    <p>
      i stopped trying stuff and took a step back and thought what does a mower
      need to start ignition, air and fuel. i had check the spark plug and the
      air filter and check fuel level all were good but i then followed the fuel
      line from the tank and discovered this mower has a valve so i turned it on
      and it started on the second pull
    </p>
    <h3>how did you feel throughout the process?</h3>
    <p>
      frustrated and angry that i might have spent 800 on a non working mower
      turns out i just wasnt as experienced as i thought
    </p>

    <h3>what did you learn?</h3>
    <p>
      to slow down think things through and not assume the worst from the outset
    </p>

    <h2>2. elegantly solved a problem.</h2>

    <h3>what was the problem?</h3>
    <p>
      Our dryer door latch broke during winter and we couldnt find anywhere we
      could get a replacement part
    </p>

    <h3>what problem-solving techniques did you use?</h3>
    <p>
      laid out the exact problem we needed to solve. all we needed was a way to
      keep the door closed while a cycle was going and be able to open it when
      it was done. We then asked ourselves have we solved this problem before
      and we had we put child locks on all the doors and cupboards our son could
      reach so we bought another one and put it on and now it works fine.
    </p>

    <h3>how did you feel throughout the process?</h3>
    <p>
      Frustrated that we werent able to find the part but then elated when we
      discovered the child lock solution
    </p>

    <h3>what did you learn?</h3>
    <p>
      some times you need to reframe the problem and see if you have already
      solved it
    </p>

    <h2>
      3. Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving
      techniques/processes:
    </h2>

    <h3>Pseudocode</h3>
    <p>Confident</p>
    <h3>Trying something</h3>
    <p>Confident</p>
    <h3>Rubber ducky method</h3>
    <p>Confident</p>
    <h3>Reading error messages</h3>
    <p>
      Sometimes they are too broad to bring much clarity as to where you have
      coded wrong
    </p>
    <h3>Console.logging</h3>
    <p>Very confident</p>
    <h3>Googling</h3>
    <p>Confident</p>
    <h3>Asking your peers for help</h3>
    <p>Confident but it does take me a little longer to ask for any help</p>
    <h3>Asking coaches for help</h3>
    <p>Same as above</p>
    <h3>Improving your process with reflection</h3>
    <p>
      Confident i often get the code working and then sit back and question do i
      really understand why this solves the problem
    </p>
    <h2>
      4. Reflect on a time you were reluctant to ask for help. Consider what
      made you reluctant to do so. What might you try differently next time?
    </h2>
    <p>
      Often times when i was running my business clients werent able to pay
      ontime and we were short on our budget for essentials like food and
      utilities, and i didnt want to ask for help because i thought i have a
      business im making a lot of money most weeks but it allway got spent but
      after a wwekly chat with my brother he got serious and asked me point
      blank are you struggling and i finally had to relent and say yes he asked
      how much we needed to get by until we get paid and i told him and he sent
      me through twice the amount i told and said next time ask as soon as you
      know you are struggling we dont want to see you guys starving or on the
      street, So thats what i try to do
